					+ "instance) there is a handover of work from individual i to individual "
					+ "j if there are two subsequent activities where the first is completed "
					+ "by i and the second by j. This notion can be refined in various ways. "
					+ "For example, knowledge of the process structure can be used to detect "
					+ "whether there is really a causal dependency between both activities. "
					+ "It is also possible to not only consider direct succession but also "
					+ "indirect succession using a \"causality fall factor\" beta, i.e., if there "
					+ "are 3 activities in-between an activity completed by i and an activity "
					+ "completed by j, the causality fall factor is beta^3.",

			REASSIGNMENT = "Reassignment",
			REASSIGNMENT_DESCR = "Reassignment metric: It considers the type of event. Thus "
					+ "far we assumed that events correspond to the execution of activities. "
					+ "However, there are also events like reassigning an activity from one "
					+ "individual to another. For example, if i frequently delegates work to "
					+ "j but not vice versa it is likely that i is in a hierarchical relation "
					+ "with j. From a SNA point of view these observations are particularly "
					+ "interesting since they represent explicit power relations.",

			SUBCONTRACTING = "Subcontracting",
			SUBCONTRACTING_DESCR = "Subcontracting metric: The main idea is to count the number "
					+ "of times individual j executed an activity in-between two activities "
					+ "executed by individual i. This may indicate that work was subcontracted "
					+ "from i to j. All kinds of refinements mentioned in Handover of work metric "
					+ "are also possible.",

			WORKING_TOGETHER = "Working together",
			WORKING_TOGETHER_DESCR = "Working together metric: This ignores causal dependencies "
					+ "but simply counts how frequently two individuals are performing activities "
					+ "for the same case. If individuals work together on cases, they will have a "
					+ "stronger relation than individuals rarely working together. There are three "
					+ "kinds of methods to calcuate working together metric. The first one is dividing "
					+ "the number of joint cases by the number of cases in which individual i appeared. "
					+ "It is important to use a relative notation. For example, suppose that individual "
					+ "i participates in three cases, individual j participates in six cases, and they "
					+ "work together three times. In this situation, i always work together with j, but "
					+ "j does not. Thus, the value for i to j has to be larger than the value for j to i. "
					+ "Alternative metrics can be composed by taking the distance between activities "
					+ "into account.";
